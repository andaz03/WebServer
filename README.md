 Multithreaded Server Development Networking Project

Developed a high-performance multithreaded server to optimize concurrent connections, achieving a throughput of 501,602 requests per minute.

– Implemented advanced threading techniques in Core Java for enhanced server efficiency and responsiveness.

– Integrated a robust thread pool mechanism to manage concurrent connections, ensuring optimal resource utilization and scalability.

– Demonstrated expertise in network programming and computer networks to design a reliable and secure communication framework.

– Utilized JMeter for performance testing, validating the server's capability to handle high loads and optimizing code for maximum throughput.

– Developed and debugged code using Intellij IDEA, adhering to best practices for code quality and maintainability.

– Documented system architecture, design decisions, and implementation details for future reference and team collaboration.

– Collaborated with cross-functional teams to troubleshoot and resolve complex issues, maintaining a stable and resilient server infrastructure.

– Technology Used: Core Java, Socket Programming, Computer Networks, JMeter, Intellij IDEA.
